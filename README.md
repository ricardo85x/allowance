# Allowance dApp

### Manage the payment of your employees (or children)

In this dApp you can be either the boss or the employee.

In the boss **tab** you can:
- hire an employee with name, address and salary.
- dismiss an employee.
- pay the employee's salary.
- pay a bonus to all employees at once.
- the system indicates if the salary has already been paid in the current month, and does not allow you to pay twice!

On the employee **tab** you can:
- check when your salary is available for withdrawal.
- withdraw your salary.
- resign.

A stable FUSD currency is used to make payments.
This coin follows the Open Zeppelin ERC20 standards.

Add this coin to Metamaks on Employee TAB

Stay while and have fun
